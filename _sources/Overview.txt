Introduction
==============

The Multi-UART component provides a software library that allows the use of 8 bit ports for multiple channel UART communication. This library is dynamically re-configurable for applications that require a level of flexibility during operation.

This document describes an overview of the Multi-UART component, resource requirements, API and programming details. It follows the examples that are given in the app_multi_uart_demo.

Supported Functionality
------------------------

The Multi-UART provides the following functionality. All options are dynamically reconfigurable via the API.

    * - Function
      - Operational Range
      - Notes
    * - Baud Rate
      - 150 to 115200 bps
      - Dependent on clocking (see :ref:`sec_ext_clk`)
    * - Parity
      - {None, Mark, Space, Odd, Even}

    * - Data Length
      - 1 to 30 bits
      - Max 30 bits assumes 1 stop bit and no parity.
