Introduction
The topic of this paper is Innovative methods by NGOs and scaling. This paper analyses some of the methods followed by NGOs to address issues that the government failing to address. Some of these methods are small scale models; this paper tries to explain difficulties in scaling these models at a higher level. Case studies were conducted on some major NGOs working on large scale and some NGOs working in small scale but producing good results. The observations made are on these case studies.
They key questions asked in this research are:
·	What is the need for the NGOs?
·	Who are the major beneficiaries of the educational NGOs?
·	What are the ways in which NGOs are working on these issues?
·	Can those methods be scaled up?

Need for the NGOs: 
In India government is trying to achieve 100 % literacy from the past 60 years, but we are still in the range of 74% [1] which is below the world’s average literacy rate (84%). Literacy rate does not give the full picture of India’s education system. The enrolment rate, retention rate, dropout rate are the other indices that show progress in quality of education and students overall improvement. Even though enrolment rate is 96% [1] Dropout rates are still in the range of 30% [1]. Government’s new policies & acts like SSA are providing government some success in terms of enrolment and dropout rates. But these programs may not be able to provide quality education unless they take in to account the new improvements in technology and need for alternative education methodologies. 
          NGOs are essential to point out failures of the government either directly or through their work. Some NGOs work on the sole purpose of proving some value to their beneficiary, where as some work to make the beneficiary what they can expect from the government. NGOs in education are contributing to improve quality of education. Some NGOs are working along with the government to implement their ideologies. Some NGOs are working through partnerships along with other NGOs. Partnership of government bodies with NGOs might increase the accountability of the government body. There are instances where the government is just a voluntary agency, for example HOSHANGABAD curriculum implementation in Madhya Pradesh. This partnership encouraged many other partnerships between NGOs and government.  In the recent years such partnerships have increased. But this doesn’t mean that NGOs should work along with the government projects. NGOs need to find beneficiary who are neglected by the government schemes and they should find ways to address their problems. 

Literature review:
In this section I will review two papers. First one is the research paper by Alice Jowett, Caroline Dyer [2] which talks about scaling up of the educational NGOs.  

Scaling of educational NGOs:
This paper talks about different methods of scaling up the NGOs through replication. NGOs need to scale up at some point of time to ‘achieve more’. This paper discusses the differences between scaling up and replication. Replication is one means to achieve scaling up. Selecting the pathways of scaling up is also as much as important selecting the initiative to be scaled up. For countries like India replication is more suitable to achieve scaling. It gives the NGO opportunity to work on larger sector as well it still preserves NGO’s perspective on the problem. Due to the view of the donors that initiatives must be scalable in future it is better for the NGOs to experiment the small scale model. Choosing replication as a means of scaling-up has its own specific advantages and disadvantages which depend on path they chose to replicate. The most important thing that decide the success of the replication is the appropriateness of the initiative in the particular local background. This can be a huge factor in India where there is cultural diversity. My view is that before replication in full scale in some other locality, it is better to implement similar model and understand the draw backs. 
	The paper also talks about different methods of replicating an initiative. I will be expressing my view on some specific methods. First is mandated replication, it shows both methods one in which the NGO doesn’t have any decision making position, but they can only initiate Ideas. This is like case of Hoshangabad project, which was a failure in the end. By giving the government more part in the decision making the NGO is most likely to lose its identity. The second method shows a partnership method in which both the government and NGO will have equal part in decision making. This method most likely will achieve the mutual interests. Balsakhi program is an example of such case. The next method is Franchise replication in which the NGO will keep on expanding their reach through some other NGO body while giving their continuous support. This program is like partnership of two NGOs. This program will work in the case of two NGOs having similar resources for example teacher trainers. There are advantages with this method with respect to competition for funding; other two methods are staged replication and concept replication. Staged replication may not work in Indian circumstances as we need to scale up so that the number of beneficiary should increase manifold, otherwise the program might lose its structure before reaching the larger communities. But the staged replication can be used for testing of the program in different localities. Concept replication is the most flexible type implementation where the main aspects of a successful program are replicated by the same or some other independent organization. 

Target Groups:
 In this section I will explain the problems faced by few target groups. The next section will give details about different innovative programs implemented by different NGOs to address those problems. The target groups that I will be discussing are Schools in rural area, Orphans, girls. 

Schools in rural India:
Facilities are always the major concerns in the case of rural schools. Some schools do not have proper classrooms, toilets, lab, and computer facilities. After implementation of SSA infrastructural problems were addressed. Computer and Lab facilities are not available in most of the schools.  Quality of teachers, Absenteeism of teachers and lack of motivation, critical teacher - student ratios, lack of awareness about quality education in students and parents are major factors concerning the teaching. Activities at school are major parts of child’s holistic development. Children need to participate in cultural, social and sports activities in school. Due to the lack of facilities and inability of teachers in recognizing the talents and encouraging the students, students from rural areas lack in communication skills and the talent of many students goes unrecognized. Students need to spend some time with the parents so that they can convey their problems in the school. Most of the parents in rural place are uneducated or occupied with work. Hence children will not get proper guidance in academic related problems. Another important issue is the drop out in rural places. Dropout rate of boys (32%)[1] is more than that of girls(25%)[3]. The major factor for dropout for boys are ‘students not interested’ (31%)[3], ‘financial constraints’ (12%) [3]. Poverty forces many boys to dropout from schools, so that join the workforce along with their parents.
 
Girls: 
With government programs like SSA, KGBV providing facilities to promote girl education there is decline in girl dropout rate at primary level. Girl dropouts have more reasons than just poverty. Also these programs do not address girl drop outs at higher education. So girls need more than basic education during their primary education. When we look at the reasons for girl dropout rates (rural) the major factors are ‘students not interested’ (31%),’ parents not interested’ (17.4%), ‘financial constraints’ (10.2%) [3]. Second major reason is a major concern specific to the girls. This survey shows that there are parents in rural in India who feels insecurity or uncomfortable about sending their daughters to school. The major reasons for dropping out in the case of urban girls are ‘students not interested’ (36.6%), ‘unable to cope’ (14.5%), and ‘financial constraints’ (16%)[3].  We can infer that in urban area more girls are forced to work when compared to rural area.    

Orphans:
There are 23 million orphans in the age group (0-17) in India according to the survey done by SOS-children village. Juvenile Justice (JJ-2000) act states that government is responsible for providing education, shelter, food, vocational training for these children. There are 1000 registered charity run orphanages in India and many more are registered. According to a survey [4] 80% orphanages are providing basic education for the orphans. 40% have vocational training centres and 20% have networking with placement agencies. As these children are supposed find ways to living after reaching 18 years. The quality of education provided by the orphanages is not good enough to provide them decent jobs or scholarships. Also they need some vocational training and soft skills training.   
 
 Implementing innovation & Technology based solutions
Innovation is always a great way to change things in large scale. Innovation can be introducing technology based learning, ICT (Information and communication technology), teaching kits, new methodologies etc., I will go through each of these methods implemented to address the problems discussed in the previous section. I will also express my views about scaling up the solutions.

Technology Based Innovations:
 Due to the revolutionary improvements in technology the cost of the equipment, software has come down to a level where they can be distributed in large scale. In rural places in India it is always difficult to learn about computers as many of the people cannot afford the technology. This is observed for children from slums and orphanages. There are NGOs that are working on computer aided learning, computer training, satellite classrooms, tools to aid visual or hearing impaired. Pratham[5], Byrraju foundation[6], Azim premji[7] foundation, IBM smartkidz[5] are some of the NGOs working on computer aided learning.. 

 Computer Aided Learning: 
             Computer is one of the major tools that can be used to enhance the learning methods. Simulations, videos, pictures of the subject give better understanding than reading from books. Hence computer aided learning (CAL) is a great method to implement to improve quality of education. But in India only 2.2% of public schools have Computers an average 5/10 children share a single PC Central Government budgets only Rs 950 per school to set up computers [5]. This is very ordinary job by government. In recent times the government is trying to implement ICT technology like AAKASH tablet to bring the technology to rural students. Another problem is the knowledge of the teachers in using the technology. Pratham is working on a CAL project in 7 states affecting 90,000 children where they provide computer facilities as well as training to the teachers [5]. They created software & games called JIGAR that will help children to learn math and English.
