Introduction
==============

The Serial to Ethernet application is used to demonstarte the serial bridging capability of the Multi-UART module. aims to provide a software library that allows the use of 8 bit ports for multiple channel UART communication. This library is dynamically re-configurable for applications that require a level of flexibility during operation.

This document describes the usage of the Multi-UART module and respective API. It follows the examples that are given in the app_multi_uart_demo. This application comprises of a simple transmit and receive test and a more complex echo test application. These can be configured by using the define directives in ``main.xc``.
