Application Overview 
=====================

Introduction
------------

This application is intended to showcase the serial to ethernet bridging capability of the Multi-UART module. Existing XMOS IP modules of ethernet and TCP/IP components are utilized to achieve serial to ethernet bridging. This application also serves as an example implementation to use Multi-UART module APIs, a simple web server to configure the uart modules, and a telnet server to communicate with uart modules.
